### Visualizations and Analysis
Below are the visualizations created as part of the project, along with a summary analysis of each. 

#### Rider Breakdown

<br>
The graphic shows that in total, there were 2,344,224 rides for the given data set. Of these, the majority were male riders with only approximately 25% being female riders. Some trips had unknown genders.

#### Checkout Times by User

<br>
The majority of trips are less than 1 hour in duration. This is likely dependent on the geographic area and proximity of key tourist areas.

#### Checkout Times by Gender

<br>
Trip duration times are similar between male and female, with both having the majority of durations under 1 hour long. 

#### Trips by Weekday (per Hour)
![TripsbyWeekday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93630042/155852986-cc31c690-98ce-4292-916f-38ca33b2bf69.png)
<br>
The heaviest usage appears to occur during weekdays between 8:00am - 9:00am and again between 5:00pm - 6:00pm. Weekend usage differs and is more prominent on Saturdays and Sundays between 10:00am - 5:00pm. Based on the heat map, it also appears that there is heavier usage throughout the day on weekends while weekdays are heavier during typical work commuting hours.

#### Trips by Gender by Weekday (per Hour)
![TripsbyWeekday_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93630042/155852990-9d5f7be8-450e-4e13-b5a1-56b364741edf.png)
<br>
The usage times and days by gender mirror those seen in the general rider population (previous visualization). There are more male riders than female riders, as a whole, which accounts for the heavier usage seen in the mape. However, the days and times used mirror each other.

#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![TripsbyWeekday_Gender_day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93630042/155852994-904bbaf7-6318-4f6b-8d23-4d9d054a2b17.png)
<br>
Customer usage, compared to Subscriber, seems heavier on the weekend. This indicates customers are more likely tourists or those who use the service on the weekend for pleasure/sight-seeing. Subscribers have heavier usage throughout the week. Combined with the weekday/hours visualizations, this appears to be due to Subscribers using bikes for work commuting.

#### Top Starting and Ending Locations

<br>
Top starting and ending locations are similar and are clustered around Manhattan.
